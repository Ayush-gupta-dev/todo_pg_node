# PostgreSQL Container (db):

This container runs the PostgreSQL database.
It listens on the default PostgreSQL port (5432).

# Node.js App Container (app):

This container runs your Node.js application.
It depends on the PostgreSQL container (db).
It exposes the Node.js application on port 8081 of the host machine.

# pgAdmin Container (pgadmin):

This container runs pgAdmin, a web-based administration tool for PostgreSQL.
It depends on both the Node.js App container (app) and the PostgreSQL container (db).
It exposes the pgAdmin web interface on port 5555 of the host machine.
Web Browser:

You interact with the application and pgAdmin through a web browser.
The Node.js app is accessible at http://localhost:8081.
The pgAdmin web interface is accessible at http://localhost:5555.
Docker Compose Configuration Files:

The docker-compose.yml file defines the services, images, and configurations for the containers.
It specifies dependencies between services and maps ports from the host machine to the containers.
